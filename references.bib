	abstract = {In spite of a growing body of research and data, human ageing remains a poorly understood process. Over 10 years ago we developed the Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR), a collection of databases and tools for studying the biology and genetics of ageing. Here, we present HAGR's main functionalities, highlighting new additions and improvements. HAGR consists of six core databases: (i) the GenAge database of ageing-related genes, in turn composed of a dataset of {\textgreater}300 human ageing-related genes and a dataset with {\textgreater}2000 genes associated with ageing or longevity in model organisms; (ii) the AnAge database of animal ageing and longevity, featuring {\textgreater}4000 species; (iii) the GenDR database with {\textgreater}200 genes associated with the life-extending effects of dietary restriction; (iv) the LongevityMap database of human genetic association studies of longevity with {\textgreater}500 entries; (v) the DrugAge database with {\textgreater}400 ageing or longevity-associated drugs or compounds; (vi) the CellAge database with {\textgreater}200 genes associated with cell senescence. All our databases are manually curated by experts and regularly updated to ensure a high quality data. Cross-links across our databases and to external resources help researchers locate and integrate relevant information. HAGR is freely available online (http://genomics.senescence.info/).},

	abstract = {From aardwolves and bandicoots to yapoks and zorillas, Ernest P. Walker's Mammals of the World is the most comprehensive—the pre-eminent—reference work on mammals. Now, completely revised and updated, this fascinating guide is better than ever. Providing a complete account of every genus of mammal in all historical time, the sixth edition is 25 percent longer than its predecessor. Of the previous generic accounts, 95 percent have been substantively modified, and there are 80 new ones—among them, three remarkable, large ungulates recently discovered in the forests of Indochina. New also is a full account of the woolly mammoth, now known to have survived until less than 4,000 years ago.Each section of the book describes one genus and includes facts such as scientific and common names, the number and distribution of species, measurements and physical traits, habitat, locomotion, daily and seasonal activity, population dynamics, home range, social life, reproduction, and longevity. Textual summaries present accurate, well-documented descriptions of the physical characteristics and living habits of mammals in every part of the world. As in the last two editions, the names and distributions of every species of every genus are listed in systematic order. These lists have now been cross-checked to ensure coverage of all species in the comprehensive new Smithsonian guide, Mammal Species of the World. Facts on the biology of mammals have been brought together from more than 2,700 newly cited references, nearly all published in the last decade. Also new are the latest data on reproduction, longevity, fur harvests, numbers in the wild and in captivity, and conservation status. The sixth edition also records all official classifications of every mammal species and subspecies in the massive 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals.The illustrations—more than 1,700—include virtually every genus of mammal. Among them are pictures by such noted wildlife photographers as Leonard Lee Rue III, Bernhard Grzimek, David Pye, and Warren T. Houck. Mammals pictured here for the first time include the just-discovered giant muntjac deer of Viet Nam, a rodent known only from the Solomon Islands, a large fruit bat whose male suckles the young, and an extremely rare web-footed tenrec of Madagascar.Since its publication in 1964, Walker's Mammals of the World has become a favorite guide to the natural world for general readers as well as an invaluable resource for professionals. This sixth edition represents more than half a century of scholarship—Ernest P. Walker himself devoted more than thirty years to the original project—and remains true to Walker's vision, smoothly combining thorough scholarship with a popular, readable style to preserve and enhance what the Washington Post called "a landmark of zoological literature."},

Here, we consider the role that other hare predators play in shaping the cycles, using a predator–prey model for up to three separate specialist predators. We consider the Canada lynx, coyote (Canis latrans) and great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). Our model improves on past modelling efforts in two ways: (1) our model solutions more closely represent the boreal hare and predator cycles with respect to the cycle period, maximum and minimum hare densities and maximum and minimum predator densities for each predator, and (2) our model sheds light on the role each specialist plays in regulation of the hare cycle, in particular, the dynamics of the raptor appear to be crucial for characterising the low hare densities correctly.},

In natural systems, there are several other factors, e.g., prey refuge, affect the success of pest control. In this paper, we analyze a predator-prey system with prey refuge and additional food for predator apart from the focal prey in the presence of diffusion. Our main aim is to study the interactive effects of prey refuge and additional food on the system dynamics and especially on the controllability of prey (pest). Different types of Turing patterns such as stripes, spots, holes, and mixtures of them are obtained. It is found that the supply of additional food to the predator is unable to control the prey (pest) population when prey refuge is high. Moreover, when both prey refuge and additional food are low, spatial distribution of prey becomes complex and once again prey control becomes difficult. However, the joint effect of reduction in prey refuge and the presence of appropriate amount of additional food can control prey (pest) population from the system.},

Under some assumptions, it is proved that the spreading speed of the prey is slower than in the case where the predator vanishes, and the density of the prey on the coexistence domain is also smaller compared with the case where interspecies actions disappear. Therefore, the predator has a negative effect on the evolution of the prey by slowing the spreading speed and decreasing the population density of the prey.},

	abstract = {The phenomenology and causes of snowshoe hare cycles are addressed via construction of a three-trophic-level population dynamics model in which hare populations are limited by the availability of winter browse from below and by predation from above. In the absence of predators, the model predicts annual oscillations, the magnitude of which depends on habitat quality. With predators in the system, a wide range of additional dynamics are possible: multi-annual cycles of various periods, quasiperiodicity, and chaos. Parameterizing the model from the literature leads to the conclusion that the model is compatible with the principal features of the cycle in nature: its regularity, mean period, and the observed range of peak-to-trough amplitudes. The model also points to circumstances that can result in the cycle's abolition as observed, for example, at the southern edge of the hare's range. The model predicts that the increase phase of the cycle is brought to a halt by food limitation, while the decline from peak numbers is a consequence of predation. This is consistent with factorial field experiments in which hare populations were given supplemental food and partial surcease from predators. The results of the experiments themselves are also reproducible by the model. Analysis of the model was carried out using a recently developed method in which the original dynamical system is reformulated as a perturbation of a Hamiltonian limit wherein exist infinite numbers of periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic motions. The periodic orbits are continued numerically into non-Hamiltonian regions of parameter space corresponding to the situation in nature. This procedure allows one to obtain an overall understanding of the geometry of parametric dependencies. The present study represents the first formulation of a full three-trophic-level snowshoe hare model and the first time any model of the cycle has been parameterized entirely using independently measured quantities.},

The existence of refuges can clearly have important effects on the coexistence of predators and prey. Previous models have only considered the effects of a constant proportion or constant number of prey using refuges. However, these are only two special cases from among the range of possible patterns of refuge use. We show the general conditions for when refuge use should have a stabilizing effect on Lotka-Volterra-type predator-prey systems. For a stabilizing effect, the proportion of prey in refuges must either: (1) decrease with increasing prey density, or (2) increase with both increasing predator density and increasing predation pressure. We also examine the effect of the cost of refuge use in decreased prey feeding or reproductive rates. Finally, we review some relevant empirical data and present some new data of our own.},

	abstract = {The snowshoe hare and the Canadian lynx in the boreal forests of North America show 9- to 11-year density cycles. These are generally assumed to be linked to each other because lynx are specialist predators on hares. Based on time series data for hare and lynx, we show that the dominant dimensional structure of the hare series appears to be three whereas that of the lynx is two. The three-dimensional structure of the hare time series is hypothesized to be due to a three-trophic level model in which the hare may be seen as simultaneously regulated from below and above. The plant species in the hare diet appear compensatory to one another, and the predator species may, likewise, be seen as an internally compensatory guild. The lynx time series are, in contrast, consistent with a model of donor control in which their populations are regulated from below by prey availability. Thus our analysis suggests that the classic view of a symmetric hare–lynx interaction is too simplistic. Specifically, we argue that the classic food chain structure is inappropriate: the hare is influenced by many predators other than the lynx, and the lynx is primarily influenced by the snowshoe hare.},
